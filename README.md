# Pastejacking with JavaScript

![Pastejacking Illustration](pastejacking_illustration.png)

## Overview

Pastejacking is a technique that involves manipulating clipboard data using JavaScript to perform unwanted actions when a user pastes the copied content. This technique can be used for malicious purposes, such as injecting malicious code, stealing sensitive information, or performing unauthorized actions on a user's behalf.

## How It Works

When a user copies content to their clipboard, JavaScript code can intercept the paste event and modify the clipboard data before it is pasted. This manipulation can include injecting additional code or altering the intended content.

## Potential Risks

- **Code Injection**: Attackers can use pastejacking to inject malicious code into a user's clipboard, which can execute when pasted into vulnerable applications or websites.

- **Data Theft**: Sensitive information, such as passwords or personal data, can be stolen by modifying the clipboard data and capturing it when pasted.

- **Unauthorized Actions**: Pastejacking can lead to unauthorized actions, such as initiating transactions, submitting forms, or performing other actions on behalf of the user without their knowledge or consent.

## Prevention and Mitigation

To protect yourself and your users from pastejacking attacks, consider the following measures:

1. **User Education**: Educate users about the risks of pastejacking and encourage them to exercise caution when pasting content, especially from untrusted sources.

2. **Sanitize Pasted Content**: Validate and sanitize pasted content on the server-side or before executing any actions to prevent code injection or unexpected behavior.

3. **Clipboard Permissions**: Browsers and operating systems are continuously improving clipboard security. Stay updated on the latest security measures and encourage users to keep their systems and browsers up to date.

4. **Disable JavaScript Clipboard Manipulation**: Websites and web applications can disable JavaScript's ability to access or modify the clipboard by default. Consider implementing this as a security measure.

## Conclusion

Awareness of pastejacking is crucial to protect yourself and your users from potential risks. Stay vigilant, implement appropriate security measures, and educate your users to minimize the impact of this technique.
